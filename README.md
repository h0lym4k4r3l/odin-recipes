# odin-recipes
TOP HTML project
create a HTML for some recipes - practice creating content with HTML
it seems the connection to GIT HUB has been established- I will now continue the mission.
Connection to GIT HUB is secure- I am feeling more comfortable with the process of committing. I've been using Google a LOT to give me hints about what to type in the command line and into my code- is that cheating? Anyways... Continuing the project.
